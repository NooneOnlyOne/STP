# pytorch-video-recognition ([source code](https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-video-recognition))


## Introduction
This repo contains several models for video action recognition,
including C3D, R2Plus1D, R3D, P3D, I3D, T3D inplemented using PyTorch (0.4.0).

## Installation
The code was tested with Anaconda and Python 3.5. After installing the Anaconda environment:

1. Configure your dataset and pretrained model path in mypath.py.

2. You can choose different models and datasets in train.py.

    To train the model, please do:
    ```Shell
    python train.py
    ```
