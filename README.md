# Spatial-temporal Pooling for Action Recognition in Videos



The *Ferryboat-4* includes 4 action classes: *Inshore*, *Offshore*, *Traffic*, and *Negative*. 


We defined *Inshore* of a ferry as the process from appearing in camera to berthing (as shown in(A)), while *Offshore* is contrary (as shown in (B)). *Traffic* mainly includes the movement of pedestrians and vehicles, such as boarding, disembarking and others. To ensure the diversity of scenes, it includes different vehicles (motorcycle, tricycle, minibus, bicycle, and electric motorcar). Therefore, other scenes are divided into negative samples, for example standing water, stationary ferryboat and others.
